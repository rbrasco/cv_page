## Disclaimer
I am immensely proud of the code for my personal webpage, despite its imperfections. It represents a significant achievement for me, as I managed to complete it in less than a month while juggling the demands of my final exams for my mathematics Bachelor's degree. These exams were incredibly challenging, each lasting a grueling five hours. Despite the intense pressure and limited time available, I poured my heart and soul into this project. It serves as a testament to my dedication, perseverance, and ability to manage my time effectively. While it may not be the most flawless code, it stands as a tangible manifestation of my determination and commitment to pursuing my passions even in the face of adversity.
